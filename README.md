# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

### By: Andrea Claeyssen

Link to project:

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. In this project I have used Figma in order to get all of the material to complete this project. There were roughly 7 sections of which I used the Grid feature for two of them. I also used Flexboxes in areas were it was appropriate. In order to create a responsive design, I have used Media Queries to match the Figma design that was given at 1280px, 768px, and 320px.

I also added a small personal section about my hometown. I hope you enjoy my project, it was very fun to make and was my first time making a responsive design!
